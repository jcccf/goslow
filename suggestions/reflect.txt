Reflect
<!--REST-->
<b>Self-reflection</b> allows you to re-connect with your thoughts, feelings, and needs. It can help you “take stock” of attitudes and behaviors you want to keep, and those you hope to change. Making time to reflect can reduce stress by keeping you centered on what is most important for you.<br /><b>Try this</b>: <i>Keep a personal journal as a tool of self-discovery, to explore ideas, and set intentions.</i>
