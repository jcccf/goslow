Choose Consciously
<!--REST-->
<b>Choose consciously.</b> Making conscious choices based on your personal values and priorities means living with intention. It can increase your power over how you spend your time, respond to others, and react to situations.<br /><b>Try this:</b> <i>Think of one thing you want to accomplish today. Focus your mind on this intention. Notice the increased sense of control and clarity on how to proceed.</i>
