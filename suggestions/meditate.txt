Meditate
<!--REST-->
<b>Meditation</b> is the process of tuning out the world and turning your attention inward. Focus your attention on your breath, a word or phrase, or an image. <i>Observe without judgment any distracting thoughts that arise as you “tune in;” release them as you exhale. Return your attention inward.</i> Once you acquire the skill, mindfulness meditation can be done anywhere, for a few minutes or longer when possible.
