Listen to Music
<!--REST-->
<b>Music</b> can energize or relax you. Studies show it can lower blood pressure and respiration, creating a calming effect. <i>Be conscious of how music makes you feel. Choose what you need at the moment (e.g. to lighten a heavy mood; to help you relax and fall asleep).</i> Have fun discovering new music: attend performances; make your own (sing, drum, etc.). Enjoy sharing it all with your friends.
