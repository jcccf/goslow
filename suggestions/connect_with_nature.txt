Connect with Nature
<!--REST-->
<b>Nature is in perfect balance.</b> When you view it or immerse yourself in it, you can connect with your own natural equilibrium. Nature can remind you to keep life in perspective, and help you feel renewed and focused. <br /><b>Try this:</b><i> Go for a walk, take in the view outside your window, watch a squirrel, or listen to the wind. Notice how it influences your thoughts and overall mood.</i>
