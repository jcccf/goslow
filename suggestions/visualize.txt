Visualize
<!--REST-->
<b>Visualization:</b> By mentally rehearing a task you want to master, you can achieve many of the same benefits you might from actual, physical practice. <i>Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Imagine yourself acting the task (e.g. taking an exam, having an important conversation). Now, focus on how your success feels (jazzed, relieved, satisfied, smart, etc.). Stay with that feeling for a while.</i>
