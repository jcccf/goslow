Laugh
<!--REST-->
<b>Laughter</b> jolts us out of our usual state of mind and can eliminate negative feelings. As a result, humor can be a powerful antidote to burn-out. Hearty belly-laughs exercise muscles, stimulate circulation, decrease stress hormones, and increase your immune systemâ€™s defenses, making laughter one of the most beneficial stress reduction techniques you can practice.
