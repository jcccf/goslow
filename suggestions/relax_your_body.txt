Relax Your Body
<!--REST-->
<b>Progressive muscle relaxation</b> systematically relieves bodily tension and helps you feel more relaxed within minutes. <i>Starting with your toes and working your way up to your head, slowly tighten… hold… and then relax your various muscle groups (e.g. feet, legs, abdomen, buttocks, shoulders, arms, hands, face). As you release, think to yourself “these muscles are now relaxed.”</i> You may notice a feeling of heaviness as tension leaves your body.
