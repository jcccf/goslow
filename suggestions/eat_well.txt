Eat Well
<!--REST-->
<b>Eat well.</b> Quality food, eaten at regular intervals, provides the fuel your body and mind need to be productive throughout the day. It also provides the energy needed to buffer lifeâ€™s daily stressors. <i>Choose a variety of food - colors, textures, tastes - at meals. Combine foods (e.g. an apple and a piece of cheese) to create a high-energy snack. Take time to enjoy your food: notice the flavor and feel of each bite.</i>
