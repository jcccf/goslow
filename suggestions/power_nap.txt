Power Nap
<!--REST-->
<b>Power naps</b>, most effective in the afternoon, can make you more alert, reduce stress, and boost cognitive functioning. <i>Find a suitable place to relax, take a few deep breaths, and focus your attention on sleep. Enjoy giving your body this time to recharge.</i> To avoid feeling groggy afterward, limit your power nap to 20-30 minutes.
