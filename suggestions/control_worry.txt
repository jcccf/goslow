Control Worry
<!--REST-->
<b>Control worry.</b> Sometimes worry is a symptom that something needs your attention. Focusing on the source of the worry can help you explore its seriousness and take action. Other times, the source of worry is beyond your control. If such worries create repetitive thoughts or anxiety for you, learning how to “let go” can help restore peace of mind. <br /><b>Try this:</b> <i>Worried about things you cannot change? Let go of the source of the worry. Instead, take action where you can: focus on responding in a healthy way. Breathe. Move. Laugh.</i>
