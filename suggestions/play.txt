Play
<!--REST-->
<b>Play!</b> Enjoy a pleasurable, no-pressure activity. Being “child-like\" (different from “child<u>ish</u>”) allows you to explore, to experience your feelings in the moment, to release your tension in a creative way, and to rebound from disappointments with greater ease. <i>Whether it’s finger painting, jumping in leaves, or reading a book “just for fun,” take time to experience the joy of play every day.</i>
