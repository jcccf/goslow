Grow from Mistakes
<!--REST-->
<b>Grow from mistakes.</b> Successful people say what they learned from their mistakes enabled them to succeed. Give yourself permission to be imperfect so you can open yourself to learning. “Failure” doesn’t mean you aren’t doing your best. It may mean it’s time to evaluate what got in the way of a better result.<br /><b>Try this:</b> <i>Use self-examination or ask for feedback on where to focus your efforts next time to create a different outcome.</i>
