Exercise
<!--REST-->
<b>Exercise</b> is a healthy way to release pent-up energy, anger, or anxiety. Just 30 minutes of moderate exercise releases endorphins, the bodyâ€™s natural mood enhancers. Any physical movement can help relieve stress. Try walking, running, hiking, dancing, swimming, skating, shooting hoops, or working out at the gym.
