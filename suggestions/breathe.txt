Breathe

<b>Deep breathing</b> can reduce anxiety and disrupt repetitive or negative thoughts by focusing awareness on the present moment. Changing your breathing can shift your mood and perspective. <i>Try taking a deep breath in through the nose for 3 seconds... hold for 2 seconds... breathe out through the mouth for 6 seconds...</i>
